            <p><b>HTML</b> was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing. </p>

<p>Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.</p>

            <p><b>The CSS saga:</b>
                <br>The saga of CSS starts in 1994. Håkon Wium Lie works at CERN – the cradle of the Web – and the Web is starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing. One crucial part of a publishing platform is missing, however: There is no way to style documents. For example, there is no way to describe a newspaper-like layout in a Web page. Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT Media Laboratory, Håkon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Web.Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea. The separation of document structure from the document's layout had been a goal of HTML from its inception in 1990.</p></div>

        <div class="box four">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</div>
