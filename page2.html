    <div class="one">
      <p >   
        In April 2011, I finished my grad school in Bulgaria, major <q>International Economic Relationships</q>. After I graduated I wasn't sure what to do, like many of the kids who just got off college.</p>

         <p>So I started looking for a job... any type of a job that will suit my degree. I was ready to accept any offer, no matter how reasonable it was. Anyhow after a year of  searching for a career path I decided to start another degree and come to US.   </p>

         <p>After couple of months going back and forth with the agency which was organizing the whole trip and the job fair event I got a job offer from Alaska. The interview for the work visa also went well and I was finnaly ready to pack and start a new live far from home. </p> 
         <p>I grew up with western culture: movies , music etc. Even NBA was something that I followed very close back in the days,so going to US was a dream came true.</p>
         <p> On May 18th 2012 I landed in Alaska. I spend the whole summer there working as a prep-cook. I had two jobs at the time and that gave me a chance to save some money and move to my next destibation - Brooklyn, Ny. </p>
         <p>I moved to NY and thanks to couple of friends that I have here I was able to settle fairly well. I started working as a busboy in the end of 2012. After couple of months I found a job in Soho,Ny . I worked there for 2.5 years.Then slowly I become a waiter and in March 2016 I got an offer to manage the restaurant that I worked in as a waiter. I accept the offer and I worked there till September 2019. </p>

         <h2>Status:Married?!</h2>

         <p> I met my wife on July 5th 2015. After a year we started  leaving togheter and on 02.17.2017 we got married. We have two kids: Anthony who is 3 years old and doesn't listen to anybody besides Daddy and baby Maya who is just 6 months old.</p>

         <h2>Hobies:Not too many left..</h2>

         <p>I love to be outdoors. Anywhere at anytime.Me and my wife did some challenging hikes couple of years ago : Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon. Couple of trails around Sedona,AZ and couple of trails in NY upstate. </p>
         <p> I also had a motorcycle for 3 and a half years. But my wife got pregnant so I had to sell it. Before you get married think twice! Just jooking! I love my wife and my kids!  </p>
